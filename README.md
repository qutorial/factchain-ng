# WARNING - insecure

This is a PoC program. Security is deliberately ignored. E.g. input checks implemented 
in the client side, or ignoring auth.

Please, do not report it to me, I know.
This is how software is done today if you have time to market pressure at exteremes. :)
Let's do it, let's earn money, then somebody else will make it secure, or maybe not..
